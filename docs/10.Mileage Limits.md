# Overview

In this final lab, we will simply describe the problem that needs to be solved.  It will be up to you to implement the solution using the tools that you have learned during this course.

# Problem Description

UMove rents premium vehicles but for those it imposes a daily mileage limit.  

The mileage limit for all vehicles made by  "MERCEDES-BENZ"  is 20 kilometers.  Monitor all vehicles and log an alert using Sinks.logger whenever a vehicle reaches its daily mileage limit.  Note we are using 20 miles so we won't have to wait a long time for a vehicle to cross the threshold.

For extra credit, figure out how to reset the daily mileage at midnight eastern time each day.



Notes

- The make and model of each car is available in an HSQLDB database.  Refer to lab 6, "Maintenance Alerts"  for the table name, column names and connection details. 

- The "ScheduledExecutor" has an API which will configure a recurring job in the cluster.  

- Some tasks may need to be done only once whenever the cluster starts.  You can execute this sort of cluster initialization code in the first member to start using the following idiom: 

  ```java
  Member localMember = hz.getCluster().getLocalMember();
  Member firstMember = hz.getCluster().getMembers().iterator().next();
  
  if (localMember.getUuid().equals(firstMember.getUuid())) {
      _log.info("I am the oldest member.");
      // do cluster initialization tasks
  }
  
  ```
