# Overview

UMove wants to keep track of vehicles that are in certain areas of interest.  In this lab, you will update the  vehicle monitoring job to do just that.

The areas of interest are defined in the areas map.  Areas are rectangular and are characterized by a name and a minimum and maximum latitude and a minimum and maximum longitude.  Areas also contain a list of VINs.  For this lab, you can assume that areas do not overlap so a vehicle is in at most one are at a time.  The job you write should keep that list updated.
