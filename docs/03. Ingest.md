# Overview

Until now we have only configured, started and stopped Jet.  In this lab we are finally going to do something useful with Jet.

We have 2 sources of fleet data, "Alpha" and "Beta".  Both sources have the same logical content but they differ by format and also delivery mechanism.  "Alpha" consists of CSV files in a shared directory that we must watch.  The other source, "Beta",  is a JSON formatted web service that must be polled. The first can be read with an out of the box source but the second will require a custom source.  

Both streams will have the same IMap, named "positions" as their sink.  

> Tip: while the original sources cannot be checkpointed or replayed, the IMap supports both.  Later, when we develop additional streams we will use the IMap as a source.  This is one way to take an external source which you have no control over, and make it effectively support checkpoint and restart !



# Source Alpha

GPS pings are appended to files in the `/opt/project/data/alpha` directory.  The name of the file is the vehicle VIN with a `.csv` suffix.  The fields are: vin, latitude, longitude, time.  The time field is expressed as seconds since a fixed point in time.  An example from one file is shown below:

```csv
