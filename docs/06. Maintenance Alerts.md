# Overview

In this lab we will be using Jet to deliver maintenance notifications.  Along the way we will see how Jet can effectively join data from different sources.  In this case, maintenance notices in a file will be joined with vehicle reference data in a database.

# Specifications

Write a on demand job to send maintenance notifications.  This job should scan the contents of the maintenance notice file , join it with the VIN database and produce a maintenance notice (for this lab, just log a message) for each impacted vehicle in the fleet. 

Note that unlike the other jobs that process an infinite stream of messages and do not end, this job does end.  Modify the main program to wait for the job to exit as shown below.

```java
				...
        Pipeline pipeline = buildPipeline();
        jet.newJob(pipeline, config).join();  // join will wait for the job to finish
```



Maintenance notices will be written to the file: `/opt/project/data/maintenance/notices.txt`. The file will be CSV formatted.  An example is shown below.

```
Notice Num,Year, Make, Model,Note 
1, 2002, Dodge, Durango, Inspect wheel bearings for premature wear.
2, 2014, Honda, Civic, Emissions issue.
```



The map between year/make/model and VIN is in a database table.  The connection information is as follows:

- Driver: org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver
- URL: jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/umove
- User: "SA"
- Password: ""

To inspect the data, you can use any SQL client. The hsqldb sql client tool is included with the lab materials and can be run with the `sqltool.sh` script. 

The image below show the table layout and a sample of the data.
