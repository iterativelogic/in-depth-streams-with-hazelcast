# Overview



> Tip: while the original sources cannot be checkpointed or replayed, the IMap supports both.  Later, when we develop additional streams we will use the IMap as a source.  This is one way to take an external source which you have no control over, and make it effectively support checkpoint and restart !



# About Source Alpha
